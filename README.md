# Random-Walks
Theoretical and computational aspects of Random Walkers

I include a source code in Python to perform simulations for non-biased Random Walkers. I will update the files once I start getting more work done on this project. The script contains explanations and considerations from both theory and computational issues, regarding the way I implemented the Random Walker in this porject in Python. The explanations are, for now, only available in catalan but soon I will add a copy in english.
